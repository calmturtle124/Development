                                    If they select “All price”, there is no limit of price on showing items. If they select
                                    “Price $5 - $10”, only items with a price in the range [5, 10) would be shown.
                                    If they select “Price >= $10”, only items with a price larger or equal than 10 would be
                                    shown.

                                    component itself. If the user adds an item, a new Map will be generated, which is exactly the

                                    price; if the user removes an item from the cart, the new price state will be the old price - that item's

                                    if the user clicks the button again (now the button at the same position is the unsorted button), the sorted state

                            In this project, I learned basic knowledge of React, including the component structure and hooks. In the future, I will continue to learn React and try to make a more complex web application, for example, a full stack project that can store user’s data (like the card items) in a database then it won’t go after the page refresh.
